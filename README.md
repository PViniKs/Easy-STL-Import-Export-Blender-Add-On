# Easy STL Import/Export Blender Add-On
Modified version of native "Import-Export STL files" blender add-on, with keyboard shortcuts for import and export operators

> [!NOTE]
> This Add-On is a modified version of the original STL Import/Export Add-On that comes with Blender. It was modified to add keyboard shortcuts for the import and export operators, making it easier to use, as you don't need to go through all the menu.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The original Add-On documentation is found at:
https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/3.5/addons/import_export/mesh_stl.html

> [!TIP]
> The only changes made to the original Add-On were at "register" and "unregister" functions, where keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + I for import / Ctrl + E for export) were added.
