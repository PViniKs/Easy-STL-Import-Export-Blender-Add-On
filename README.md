# Easy-STL-Import-Export-Blender-Add-On
Modified version of native "Import-Export STL files" blender add-on, with keyboard shortcuts for import and export operators

> [!NOTE]
> THIS ADDON IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL STL IMPORT/EXPORT ADDON THAT COMES WITH BLENDER.
IT WAS MODIFIED TO ADD KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS FOR THE IMPORT AND EXPORT OPERATORS, MAKING IT EASIER TO USE, AS YOU DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MENU.

THE ORIGINAL ADDON DOCUMENTATION IS FOUND AT:
https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/3.5/addons/import_export/mesh_stl.html

THE ONLY CHANGES MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ADDON WERE AT "register" AND "unregister" FUNCTIONS, WHERE KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS (Ctrl + I for import / Ctrl + E for export) WERE ADDED.
